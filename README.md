## MVP
- display a bunch (_how many and what?_) of Pokemon images on the index (views/index.ejs)
- have separate show pages for each Pokemon (views/show.ejs, index/:id), accessible by clicking on a Pokemon's image on the index page
- the ability to add a new Pokemon 
- the ability to edit existing Pokemon
- the ability to delete Pokemon
- some styling
